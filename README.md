## 💼 About Me

I'm a final-year MCA student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I have hands-on experience building data-driven and AI-powered applications using Python, SQL, ML/DL frameworks, and LLM-based tools. I’ve developed and deployed real-world projects involving text generation, prediction models, and dashboards. Currently seeking full-time opportunities or internships in Data Science, ML, or Generative AI.
